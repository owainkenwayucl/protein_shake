# Trying to work out how to install this on ATLAS.

There are definitely some challenges with getting this going, not least of all the messy and confusing dependencies.

I don't know if Mamba will let us install torch/tensorflow (apparently both are in the environment.yaml) with pip and match deps.

Anyway, to kick things off I'm downloading the massive datasets onto ATLAS.
